# Discuss Platform â€” Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)

This repository contains the frontend for a small decentralized discussion platform built with React + TypeScript + Vite. It demonstrates client-side IPFS pinning (Pinata), a lightweight Gemini/Vertex AI helper, and a simple backend for WebSocket relay and an AI proxy.

## What this system does

- Frontend UI (Vite + React + TypeScript) where users can create discussions, attach media, request AI assistance for tags/content, and view a live discussion feed.
- Client-side Pinata helpers for uploading files and JSON metadata to IPFS: see [`uploadFileToPinata`](frontend/src/services/pinata.js) and [`uploadMetadataToIPFS`](frontend/src/services/pinata.js).
- Lightweight LLM helpers that call a configurable LLM HTTP endpoint or the local backend proxy: see [`analyzeForTags`](frontend/src/services/gemini.js) and [`askAgent`](frontend/src/services/gemini.js).
- Local WebSocket relay backend at [backend/server.js](backend/server.js) that broadcasts incoming messages to connected clients (used for real-time new-discussion notifications).
- Context provider to manage discussions in-app: see [`DiscussionsProvider`](frontend/src/contexts/discussionsData.tsx) and the hook [`useDiscussions`](frontend/src/contexts/useDiscussions.ts).

## Quick start (development)

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)

1. Install dependencies

   - Frontend:
     ```sh
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Backend:
     ```sh
     cd ../backend
     npm install
     ```

2. Configure environment variables

   - Frontend: update [frontend/.env](frontend/.env) with your Vite env values (Pinata keys, API URLs).
   - Backend: update [backend/.env](backend/.env) with PORT, PINATA keys (if used server-side), and Google/Vertex settings (GEMINI_MODEL, GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID, GOOGLE_REGION). Ensure service account credentials are available or set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS.

3. Start the backend (WebSocket + AI proxy)

   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

   This runs [backend/server.js](backend/server.js) which hosts the WebSocket server and an AI proxy endpoint at `/api/ai/respond`.

4. Start the frontend (Vite dev server)
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open the app at the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173). The frontend connects to the backend WebSocket by default at ws://localhost:3000.

## Build (production)

- Build the frontend:

  ```sh
  cd frontend
  npm run build
  ```

  (The script runs `tsc -b` then `vite build` per [frontend/package.json](frontend/package.json).)

- Backend has no production build step; deploy [backend/server.js](backend/server.js) to your Node host or container.

## How to use / features

- Create discussions with text, optional media, optional link, and AI-assisted tag suggestions. The create flow uploads media via [`uploadFileToPinata`](frontend/src/services/pinata.js) and uploads metadata via [`uploadMetadataToIPFS`](frontend/src/services/pinata.js).
- Tag suggestions and agent replies are fetched via the Gemini helper functions in [`frontend/src/services/gemini.js`](frontend/src/services/gemini.js). By default the frontend will call the backend proxy at `/api/ai/respond` when VITE_GEMINI_API_URL is not set.
- New discussions are broadcast to connected clients via the backend WebSocket server in [backend/server.js](backend/server.js) (message type `new-discussion`).

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   ```

2. Follow these guidelines:

   - Keep TypeScript types accurate; prefer using existing types in [frontend/src/types.ts](frontend/src/types.ts).
   - Run lints and fix warnings:
     ```sh
     cd frontend
     npm run lint
     ```
   - Ensure new UI code is consistent with existing components (`CreateDiscussion`, `DiscussionFeed`, `Sidebar`) and the discussions context [`DiscussionsProvider`](frontend/src/contexts/discussionsData.tsx).

3. Make small, focused PRs with descriptive titles and link to related issues.

4. Review checklist for PRs:
   - Code builds and the dev server starts (`npm run dev`).
   - No TypeScript errors.
   - Behaviour is covered manually; add tests where appropriate.

## Security & secrets

- Pinata keys in the client are visible to users. For production, move secret operations to a server-side endpoint or use a low-privilege proxy.
- Backend uses Google service account credentials for Vertex AI. Never commit service-account.json into the repo; set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` on the server or use a secrets manager.

## Troubleshooting

- WebSocket not connecting: verify backend is running and the frontend WS URL matches ([frontend/.env](frontend/.env) VITE_WS_URL).
- AI proxy errors: ensure `GEMINI_MODEL`, `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`, and credentials are configured in [backend/.env](backend/.env).
